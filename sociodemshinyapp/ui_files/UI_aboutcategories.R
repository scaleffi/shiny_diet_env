        "These tabs allow you to compare absolute and per capita environmental footprints associated with the estimated demand of fifteen food groups, across regions.<br><br>
              We also grouped the fifteen food groups into three macrocategories: Animal Source Foods (ASF), Staples, and Other. This is an arbitrary classification made for the
              purpose of this dashboard, with the goal of making it easier for the user to make comparisons at a glance. By combining information on both the food group
              and the macrocategory, the user can explore how different categories of food impact each environmental dimension, while also seeing how individual food groups contribute within each macrocategory.<br><br>
              Open the first tab if you want to focus on the fifteen separate food groups, and compare their impacts across regions. Select the second tab if instead you want to focus on the three macrocategories."
