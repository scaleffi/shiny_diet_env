              In both tabs, you can also see how much each food group contributes to the environmental footprint across the six different dimensions.<br><br> 
              If you want to compare across income regions (Low Income Countries, Low-Middle Income Countries, Upper-Middle Income Countries, High Income Countries), open the first tab. Explore the second tab instead
              if your focus is on geographical groupings."
